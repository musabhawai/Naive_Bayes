# Naive_Bayes
## 📌 Overview
This repository contains two small projects demonstrating the use of *Naive Bayes classification*:
1. *Titanic Survival Prediction* – Predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using cross-validation for model evaluation.
2. *Ads Purchase Prediction* – Predicting whether a user will purchase a product based on demographics and behavior, evaluated using a confusion matrix.

## 📖 About Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a *probabilistic classification algorithm* based on *Bayes' Theorem* with the assumption that features are independent.
Key points:
- Works well with high-dimensional data
- Fast and efficient for classification
- Commonly used in text classification, spam detection, and basic predictive tasks

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## 📂 Projects Included
### 1️⃣ Titanic Survival Prediction
- *Goal*: Predict survival chances of passengers.
- *Process*:
  - Preprocess passenger data
  - Train a *Naive Bayes* model
  - Use *Cross-Validation* for reliable performance measurement

### 2️⃣ Ad Purchase Prediction
- *Goal*: Predict if a user will purchase based on age, salary, etc.
- *Process*:
  - Preprocess user demographic data
  - Train a *Naive Bayes* model
  - Evaluate results using a *Confusion Matrix*
